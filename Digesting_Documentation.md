## READING MANUALS

In this challenge we learn how to use the man command which is used to read manuals . On running `man challenge` we recieve multiple descriptions out of which the one which is required 
to attain the flag is 
` --hxibcn NUM
print the flag if NUM is 031`
According the the following description we run the command "/challenge/challenge --hxibcn 031" to get the flag 
The flag is :  `pwn.college{0hxib3JcT1npV_Wwkogyawd3e8B.dRTM4QDLwgTN0czW}`
